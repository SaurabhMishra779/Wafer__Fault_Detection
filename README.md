**Wafer-Fault-Detection** 

""Problem Statement:""

**To build a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data as 
earlier it was difficult to predict which sensor is faulty hence once any sensor is faulty they had to check all the sensors manually and 
had to shut down then entire production during that time.**
